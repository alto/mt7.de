Back in Brighton, England for the [dConstruct](http://2013.dconstruct.org) conference, after 2008 and 2010. If it wouldn't be for the conference, visiting Brighton is worth all the time. Easy to get there (choose [Gatwick Airport](http://www.gatwickairport.com) as your destination, and take the [First Capital Connect](http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk) train for 30 minutes), grab a bed in any hotel close to the beach and make your way around. It's marvelous!

But the dConstruct conference is worth attending, too, and your time and money couldn't be spent any more unrepentantly. I got repeatedly asked what the conference is all about, and to be honest, it's not easy to answer. From what [Clearleft](http://clearleft.com) and others state on its website itself, it is a collection (a [smörgåsbord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smörgåsbord)) *"of clever clogs gathered together to twist our perceptions of technology and culture"*. Yeah, that fits. It's about technology for sure (lots of web developers and designers around), and it's about culture as well, regarding all the Internet, but even more than that. It's about how we see the world, what drives our motivation and inspiration. And anytime I get back home, I'm more focused and inspired than before. It's about that, finding your place in the world around you.

It's good to be back.
