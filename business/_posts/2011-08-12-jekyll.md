It's done, finally. Inspired by <a href="http://jan.krutisch.de">Jan Krutisch</a>, and after 
having heard so much about <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a>, I rewrote
my homepage (and yes, once again, a little redesign).

The image I used for the <a href="/personal/2011/08/12/old-window.html">header background</a> was taken by myself using <a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a>.
