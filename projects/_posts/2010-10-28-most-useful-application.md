We made it! The <a href="http://awesome-fontstacks.com">Awesome Fontstacks</a> 
are the Most Useful web application, which has been built during the 
<a href="http://railsrumble.com/">Rails Rumble 2010</a> (here's the <a href="http://railsrumble.com/entries?sort=usefulness">final result</a>). 
Thanks to everyone who voted for us! Thanks a lot to the <a href="http://railsrumble.com/teams/the-dudes">best team of the world</a>. 
And very special thanks to the man who had the idea, <a href="http://twitter.com/wowo101">Wolfgang Wopperer</a>!
