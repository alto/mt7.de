I think it's good practice to list up all the things you achieved in a year. It's not
really about telling others and brag about it, no, it's more about telling yourself
and calm down ([impostor syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) anyone?).

So let's talk about 2014. We (my wife, our five boys and me) were living in
[Hamburg, Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg) they whole year and I was
working as a freelancing software developer most of the time. Besides that...

 * While working for [XING AG](https://www.xing.com) I helped building the new
   [Communities](https://www.xing.com/communities) product, a replacement for
   the old _Groups_. It finally took us one and a half years to get there.
 * I took a link into programming with [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) and
   [Go](https://golang.org), and both are very promising alternatives to
   my current favorite [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
