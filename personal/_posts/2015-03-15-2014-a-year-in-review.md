title: 2014 – a year in review
layout: post
---

I think it's good practice to list up all the things you achieved in a year. It's not
really about telling others and brag about it. No, it's more about telling yourself
and calm down ([impostor syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) anyone?).

So let's talk about 2014. We (my wife, our five boys and me) were living in
[Hamburg, Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg) they whole year and I was
working as a freelancing software developer most of the time. Besides that...

 * While working for [XING AG](https://www.xing.com) I helped building the new
   [Communities](https://www.xing.com/communities) product, a replacement for
   the old _Groups_. It finally took us one and a half years to get there. What
   sounds like a simple forum or blackboard application is actually much more,
   especially implementing access control and integration into the rest of
   the XING universe.
 * I took a look into programming with [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) and
   [Go](https://golang.org), and both are very promising alternatives to
   my current favorite [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
 * I tried using the [Atom editor](https://atom.io). It's a very good text
   editor, with lots of nifty feature for programmers and already with
   a big community. Nonetheless, I finally stayed with
   [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)
 * We decided to return to New Zealand. It's where currently our heart is.
   We didn't finish this chapter of our life last time (in 2012/13), so
   we had to go back (I'm currently writing this post in Wellington, New
   Zealand)
 * I played around with [Docker](https://www.docker.com). It's more than
   just a new kid on the block, it's the near future. It's already mature,
   ready to use even in production and comes with a very big community (I
   somehow got the feeling this is important).
 * I went to two conferences this year. The first one is
   [Scottish Ruby Conf](http://2014.scottishrubyconference.com)
   in Edinburgh and Crieff, Scotland, a typical Ruby conference
   with lots of enthusiastic and caring people and topics about, well,
   Ruby. The second one is
   [Beyond Tellerrand](http://beyondtellerrand.com/2014/), a conference
   about working with and living in the Internet, not only about development
   or design. It's an amazing event, highly recommended!
 * I released version 4 of [AASM](https://github.com/aasm/aasm/), one of the
   open source projects I'm maintaining. It actually took more than a year
   to finish this up, so I'm glad it's out of the door.
 * I gave a talk about [AASM](https://github.com/aasm/aasm/) at
   the [Hamburg Ruby User Group](http://hamburg.onruby.de) meetup.
   General topic was
   [Open Source made in Hamburg](http://hamburg.onruby.de/events/ruby-usergroup-hamburg-dezember-2014).
 * I had to learn that communication is hard. It all started with me creating
   an [issue for paranoia](https://github.com/radar/paranoia/issues/173), asking
   for a new release, and ended with a dispute on twitter.
   I finally met this guy on the [RubyConf Australia](http://www.rubyconf.org.au/2015)
   in Melbourne, Australia, and talked to him about that issue. Still, communication
   is hard.
 * I participated in the [Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com), together with
   [Jan Krutisch](http://jan.krutisch.de),
   [Florian Munz](http://florian.munz.org) and
   [Denise Tham](http://twitter.com/deetee). We built
   [Awesome Recipes](http://www.awesomerecipes.io), which you can use to
   visually create kitchen recipes and share them with others.
   We finally made it to the 9th place, and we are overall very happy
   with the result.
 * We travelled to [Sweden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden) for the
   fourth time, and I can only say that we enjoyed it pretty much, again,
   and we will definitely come back for a fifth time (once we return
   to Europe).
 * I migrated our previous Rails Rumble project, the
   [Awesome Fontstacks](http://awesome-fontstacks.com), from
   Rails version 3 to 4.
 * I implemented JSON views, which are simple Ruby files evaluated
   as Rails views and delivering JSON strings.
 * We visited [Stralsund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stralsund)
   and [Rügen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rügen). If you find the
   time, go there and have a look yourself. Both are really beautiful.
 * I read a couple of fictional books, one of which of which I can highly
   recommend (sorry, German only):
   [Blackout](http://www.amazon.de/BLACKOUT-Morgen-ist-spät-Roman/dp/3442380294/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1429520341&sr=8-1&keywords=blackout) written by
   Marc Elsberg.
 * I finally read [Candid](http://www.amazon.de/Candid-oder-Die-Beste-Welten/dp/3150065496/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1429520479&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=voltairr) written by Voltaire (again, sorry, German only).
 * Together with my eldest son I visited the Thalia theatre in Hamburg,
   Germany, where they played [Moby Dick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick)
   without any (!) stage setting. Very, very good acting!
 * I set up my wife as the beneficiary for all of my insurances.
 * I started to use [#pants](http://pants.social), a light-weight blogging engine
   coming with a fully decentralized social network built-in (I couldn't have said
   that any better than [Hendrik](http://hmans.io) himself.
 * I switched from [Quicksilver](http://www.blacktree.com) to
   [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com), and I haven't regretted it until today.
 * I was part of the Hacktable team organising a couple of
   [Superkids events](http://www.makerhub.de/superkids/), allowing kids
   to take a look into programming and working with computers.
 * I merged two [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) accounts into one. Yes,
   I manually copied over links from one account to the other. If there's a better
   way to do this, I don't want to know.
 * [Benny](https://twitter.com/_benny) and I abandoned
   [blanksand](https://twitter.com/blanksand), our shared office space
   in the centre of Hamburg, Germany. It was finally too much effort to keep things
   up and we didn't use it enough. Sad, but true.
 * We bought a SUP for
   [Standup paddleboarding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standup_paddleboarding).
   Not cheap, but hell lot of fun. You should try it!
 * I reviewed a book about
   [Redis Applied Design Patterns](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/redis-applied-design-patterns).
   Check it out if you are interested in working with [Redis](http://redis.io).
